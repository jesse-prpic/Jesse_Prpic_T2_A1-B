## Question 2

### Identify and explain the workings of TWO search algorithms and discuss and compare their performance/efficiency (i.e Big O)

<!-- What is search algorithm in general -->
Imagine having a problem where you are needing to find a specific recipe that you forgot, throughout an online directory. You would be able to find this recipe using a search algorithms; however which one are you going to choose; Linear Search or Binary Search.

Linear search is an algorithm method that works in a sequntial matter, it looks at one element and goes to the next to seek out the desired result and doesn't matter if the list is sorted or not. 
If the result that is needing to be found is at the start of the search then this makes the linear search the simple option; however if it is towards the end this then makes this algorithm more tedious and not as efficient.

Regarding the example of a recipe that we are needing to find; if we were looking for a recipe that envolved prawns; this is going to be a tedious search with the "p" being the 16th letter of the alphabet if this were a sorted list like the example below.
